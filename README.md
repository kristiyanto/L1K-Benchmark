__LINCS / L1000  Benchmark__


This is a part for a NIH sponsored project. The goal of this project is to build a faster pipeline for processing big biomedical data (LINCS L1000 gene expression data). 

I performed benchmark of the processed data by comparing to external data sources, such as CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) and ArrayExpress.
